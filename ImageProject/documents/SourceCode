Three different pieces of code were taken from this link. The first was the Save File to and Image, 
where I modified the variables to find into my extended JPanel class. The other piece of code taken from 
this link was the algorithm that loads images from a file. Modifications were similar to the save file 
algorithm. The last piece of code taken from this link was a grayscale algorithm, where I had to create a
new color to modify the image.
