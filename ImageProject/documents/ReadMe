ReadMe File
Overview: My program has the basic features any image software would have. The controls for the 
first part of this project can be found in the file menu at the top of the screen. I have considered 
the fact that more options besides grayscale will become available, which can be added at the bottom of the 
grayscale button. The picture can be opened from a .png file, edited, then saved to the same file. The program has 
two choices for grayscaling, using either parallel programming or sequential. The program also has two choices for 
blurring an image, also using either parallel or sequential. Equalization was implemented and also has the option to 
either choose parallel or sequantial computting.

File Types Supported: PNG

Bugs: Once again, a big fallback this program has is that you cannot undo any action, so any accidental move that needs
to be fixed is requird to completly reload the picture, losing all progress made. 

The parallel equalization isn't necessarily all parallel. One kernel, the kernel that creates the modified list of 
grayscale values from the input/output histogram, pretty much the last step, does not work. This is very annoying since 
this is a simple kernel and is probably a very stupid error I am making, however I cannot seem to debug it. One loop
was added to do this part sequentially and the picture is equalized fine.

Also, I noticed that parallel takes a much longer time than sequential, so we should probably talk about that on Monday
too.
