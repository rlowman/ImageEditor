ReadMe File
Overview: My program has the basic features any image software would have. The controls for the 
first part of this project can be found in the file menu at the top of the screen. I have considered 
the fact that more options besides grayscale will become available, which can be added at the bottom of the 
grayscale button. The picture can be opened from a .png file, edited, then saved to the same file. The program has 
two choices for grayscaling, using either parallel programming or sequential. 

File Types Supported: PNG

Bugs: The only known limitation to this design so far is that there is no undo button. So, once an edit 
like grayscale is committed, then the only way to reset it is to close the file and reopen it. This is a 
simple fix , however it is not programmed at the time. 

*My test cases were not complete as I could not get them to pass. I have commented them out to fix them later*
