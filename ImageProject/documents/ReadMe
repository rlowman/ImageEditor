ReadMe File
Overview: My program has the basic features any image software would have. The controls for the 
first part of this project can be found in the file menu at the top of the screen. I have considered 
the fact that more options besides grayscale will become available, which can be added at the bottom of the 
grayscale button. The picture can be opened from a .png file, edited, then saved to the same file. The program has 
two choices for grayscaling, using either parallel programming or sequential. The program also has two choices for 
blurring an image, also using either parallel or sequential. 

File Types Supported: PNG

Bugs: Once again, a big fallback this program has is that you cannot undo any action, so any accidental move that needs
to be fixed is requird to completly reload the picture, losing all progress made. Also, a major bug is that only 
sequential blur works. When attempting to blur the image using parallelism, the image turns completely white. I attempted
to debug this, and found that for some reason my blur kernel puts the max value of an int in each slot of all three color
channels, so when combined in the last kernel, it makes the picture white-bright enough to burn your eyes out. I plan
to implement the extras on the last two parts once i get parallel blur to work to maybe earn some points back since I 
could not get all the parts to work properly on this phase.

*I activated checkstyle and it didnt give me any errors, so I'm guessing I didn't set it up right*
